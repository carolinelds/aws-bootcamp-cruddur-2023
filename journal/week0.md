# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## 0 - Stakeholder Meeting

I took some notes while watching the [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/SG8blanhAOg?feature=share):

### 0.0 Project Scenario

I am responsible for the cloud infrasctructure of an application called Cruddr, which is an ephemeral microblogging website. The goal is to build an architecture around microservices considering the the 3 application layers: UI, Business Logic and Data Access. Also I should keep in mind the [Iron Triangle](https://www.mindtools.com/aa9j1zc/the-iron-triangle-of-project-management) concept when balancing cost, time and features. 

### 0.1 Involved people

Tony is my direct manager on the startup, we have the web development team working on our side, the investors - who mostly care about cost and timing - and our fractional CTO, with whom I can discuss about the technical requirements.


### 0.2 To do

I need to present a technical report for the investors detailing the proposed architecture, a budget and ongoing cost estimate.
